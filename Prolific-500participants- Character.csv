The person who was envious of me is not close with me now but was fairly close to me at the time (maybe a 5). I was glad of his envy at the time because it was the only area in our relationship where I achieved something he didn't, and it felt like a balancing or compensating dynamic relative to my own massive envy toward him (that I did not fully recognize at the time, over 20 years ago). I read some of the closing questions quickly and I want to make clear any pro-censorship (or pro-punishment for speech) answers were accidental. I will add the qualification that while I think public libraries should be receptive to carrying these ideas, I do think they should probably decline to carry (though probably not to order upon request) books containing some other reprehensible ideas worse in some ways than those I listed. I would like to think the harms of a completely content-neutral approach to curation could always be outweighed by the benefits, but it's not clear to me that that's true. However, I think that the default orientation should be pro-open marketplace of ideas, and that exceptions should be carefully tailored and heavily scrutinized. Hope this context helps. ",
